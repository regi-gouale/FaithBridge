# AUTH

### Next.js Authentication with Server Actions

This project demonstrates a robust authentication system built with Next.js, leveraging server actions for secure and efficient user management. The key features include:

- **User Registration and Login**: Secure endpoints for user registration and login, ensuring data is handled safely.
- **Server-Side Authentication**: Utilizing Next.js server actions to handle authentication logic, providing enhanced security by processing sensitive data server-side.
- **Session Management**: Integration with session management to keep users logged in and maintain session state across multiple requests.
- **Protected Routes**: Implementation of protected routes that can only be accessed by authenticated users, ensuring a secure user experience.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Support for different user roles and permissions to control access to various parts of the application.
- **Password Recovery**: Functionality for users to reset their passwords securely via email verification.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Use of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication and easy integration with other services.

This project serves as a comprehensive example for developers looking to implement authentication in their Next.js applications using server actions.
